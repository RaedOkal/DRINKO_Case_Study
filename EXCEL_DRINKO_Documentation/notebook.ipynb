These products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including supermarkets, convenience stores, and online platforms. FMCG companies typically invest heavily in branding, advertising, and product promotion to drive consumer demand and maintain their market share.\n\nThe FMCG industry is highly competitive, with many large multinational companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Unilever, and Coca-Cola, competing for market share. The industry is also highly regulated, with companies required to meet stringent quality standards and adhere to various regulations regarding packaging, labeling, and product safety.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"86b54157-ac70-4446-a0eb-2045eebd986d"},{"source":"## Important questions\n\n our dashboard will have to answer:-\n\n**Which are their most
